# Accessibility

The PDF is a ubiquitous format. It's as familiar as the web. Yet, I've not discussed issues of accessibility concerning the format. Its inaccessibility is puzzling given that a selling point of CSS2 - 15 years ago - was accessibility, printing, and other styles that are independent of content.

A document with a well-formed structure and meta-data that should help me to work with data stored in a PDF is similar to data needed to assist those with disabilities. Like CSS and HTML, the content and the formating are able to remain seperate, and the end-users are not impeded by styling that they doesn't apply to them.

Adobe addresses [this issue](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/accessibility/pdfs/accessing-pdf-sr.pdf) and the French design firm [Ipedis](http://www.pdf-accessibility.com/) has a website devoted to the topic. Each organization suggests designing documents well from the start. Both reference the PDF/UA standard which recommends that designers use tags and xml. Both also discuss adding metadata after the fact. Adobe also notes that images of text are challenging and require OCR software. The Adobe response seems tepid because it offer only soft perscriptions.  

In March, 2017, the General Services Administration issued [new rulings on accessiblity](https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1877/ict-rule.pdf) that include use of PDF/UA. The PDF of the document is not the most accessible; it lacks a table of contents and its table columns can't be copied as columns. While, its text columns are well structured, it important data is still inaccessible.


The big take away is that the technological solution is insufficient. You must request that document producers consider accessibility from the initial design.
